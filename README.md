# COGS 189 Project
This repository contains the dataset from Competition 4 (dataset 2b) regarding left/right hand movement. More information about the dataset can be found at [https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/).

## Layout
Our goal is to apply a classification algorithm to classify left/right hand movement.
We use replicate a study from [Wang et Al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10196205/) to test a classification algorithm and view its performance. While these metrics are evaluated on their accuracy and precision,
they are also measured by exploration of different hyperparamters. We want to also explore how different classification algorithms perform on this dataset.
